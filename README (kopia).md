# 🎯 Bayesian Regression Bonanza 🚀

Welcome to our **awesome** GitHub repo for the **SF1935 Bayesian Linear Regression Project**! ✨ This is where math meets madness and code meets caffeine. ☕

## 🧠 What's this all about?
We took on the quest of predicting linear relationships with a twist: **Bayesian style**. Forget boring point estimates—we embrace uncertainty and let those posterior distributions shine! 🌈

## 🔍 What did we do?
- 📊 **Generated noisy data** pretending we didn't know the true model (but we secretly did 😏).
- 🔮 **Computed priors, likelihoods & posteriors** like true Bayesian wizards.
- 🎲 **Sampled from the posterior** to get funky lines doing the regression dance.
- 🎯 **Plotted everything**: contour plots, error bars, predictive distributions, and even a bonus **Maximum Likelihood line** (you know, for the classic fans).

## 🛠️ Tech stuff:
- Language: **MATLAB** (because matrix stuff is life)
- Libraries: `normrnd`, `mvnrnd`, and loads of plotting magic.

## 🚦 How to run:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open MATLAB (we hope you're not using Octave 🙃).
3. Run the scripts in order: from data generation 🧪 to glorious plots 🎨.

## 💡 What you'll learn:
- That Bayesian inference can be **beautiful** (and intimidating).
- Why priors + likelihoods = posterior party. 🥳
- How uncertainty isn't a bug—it's a feature!

## 📝 Bonus:
We even made comparisons with the **Maximum Likelihood approach** (because we care about tradition too). Expect reflections, plots, and some serious Bayesian swagger.

## 🤝 Contributing:
Raise an issue if you find a bug 🐞, or fork it to do something wild (like 3D Bayesian regression?! 👀).

## 📢 Final words:
> “In a world full of uncertainty, be Bayesian.”

Enjoy the ride and may your posteriors be tight and your priors well-chosen! 🚀
